# Automated-Poultry-Coop
 This project shows significant utility with practical application in the agricultural sector, specifically animal rearing. The poultry coops that are usually used nowadays are manual and do not have any safety precautions when it comes to foreign animals entering the coop accidentally. In light of this issue, an automated shed could be of service to the farmers or rearers by handling their work more efficiently. Using an automated coop, one does not have to check the inside temperature and change the yellow light intensity, or open and close the door at specified times manually. In addition, this serves as a more secure shed for whatever poultry the farmers are tending, making the rearing process trouble-free.
